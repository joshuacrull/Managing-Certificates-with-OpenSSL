<h1>OpenSSL Certificate Management Lab</h1>

<h2>Lab Description:</h2>
<p>Welcome to our OpenSSL certificate management lab on Kali Linux. In this hands-on experience, you'll dive into OpenSSL, a versatile tool for securing data. You'll learn how to create certificates, generate certificate signing requests, and convert certificate formats. OpenSSL is a vital resource for safeguarding digital information and ensuring secure communication.</p>

<h2>About OpenSSL:</h2>
<p>OpenSSL is an open-source cryptographic library that plays a crucial role in securing data, encrypting communication, and managing certificates. It supports various algorithms, formats, and protocols, making it an essential tool in the digital security toolbox.</p>

<h2>What's Inside:</h2>
<p>Inside this repository, you'll find a comprehensive guide with step-by-step instructions, code samples, and practical examples. We'll use Kali Linux as our virtual environment, incorporating languages like Bash, OpenSSL commands, and relevant libraries. Whether you're a cybersecurity enthusiast or looking to enhance your digital security skills, this lab will equip you with valuable certificate management expertise using OpenSSL.</p>



<h2>Section 1: Generating Public and Private Keys</h2>

<p><b>In this section, we will generate an asymmetric RSA key pair using OpenSSL.</b></p>
<ol>
    <li><b>First, navigate to your Documents directory and create a new directory named "keys". This is where we will store our keys.</b></li>
    <code>cd Documents</code><br />
    <code>mkdir keys</code><br />
    <code>cd keys</code>

    <li><b>Now, let's generate an Asymmetric RSA key pair. The following command will create a private key named "corp.515support.com.key" with a key length of 2048 bits.</b></li>
    <code>openssl genrsa -out corp.515support.com.key 2048</code>

    <li><b>To view the content of the private key you just generated, you can use the "cat" command:</b></li>
    <code>cat corp.515support.com.key</code>

    <li><b>Next, we'll extract the corresponding public key from the private key. This public key will be used when generating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in a later section.</b></li>
    <code>openssl rsa -in corp.515support.com.key -pubout -out corp.515support.com_public.key</code>

    <li><b>To verify that both the private and public keys have been generated and saved successfully, you can list the files in the current directory:</b></li>
    <code>ls</code>

    <li><b>Finally, you can view the content of the public key using the "cat" command:</b></li>
    <code>cat corp.515support.com_public.key</code>
</ol>

<p><b>You've now successfully generated an RSA key pair, obtained the private key, and extracted the public key. These keys are fundamental to secure communication and certificate management in OpenSSL.</b></p>
